- Foundations of statistical analysis and data visualization
- Principles of quantitative research methodology
- Hands-on applications using R and RStudio
- Practical approaches to summarizing, visualizing, and modeling linguistic data

**⋆. 𐙚 ˚ Core Skills Developed ⋆. 𐙚 ˚**
- Rigorous study design and data analysis
- Experience in open, inclusive, and diverse research practices
- Statistical inference using linear models
- Interpretation of p-values and Bayesian statistical results

**⋆. 𐙚 ˚Approach⋆. 𐙚 ˚**

The course emphasizes general principles of data analysis and fosters an egalitarian and inclusive scholarly environment. Students will develop the technical and conceptual skills necessary for contemporary linguistic research using open-source tools.

**⋆. 𐙚 ˚Learning Outcomes⋆. 𐙚 ˚**
- Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
